# Arduino Smart Thermostat

This repository contains the code and instructions to build a smart thermostat using Arduino. The thermostat can be controlled using a mobile app and can be used to monitor and control the temperature of a room or a building.

## Parts Explanation and Bill of Materials

The following is a list of the components needed to build the smart thermostat:

- Arduino Uno R3

- ESP8266 Wi-Fi module

- 2.4-inch TFT LCD display

- DS18B20 temperature sensor

- 4-channel relay module

- Breadboard

- Jumper wires

- USB cable

- 5V power supply

### Average Price per Component

- Arduino Uno R3: $10

Total cost: $35

Note: The above prices are approximate and may vary depending on your location and the supplier.

## How to Build the Arduino Smart Thermostat

To build the smart thermostat, follow these steps:

1. Connect the Arduino Uno R3 to the breadboard and connect the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module to the Arduino board.

2. Connect the 2.4-inch TFT LCD display to the breadboard and connect it to the Arduino board.

3. Connect the DS18B20 temperature sensor to the breadboard and connect it to the Arduino board.

4. Connect the 4-channel relay module to the breadboard and connect it to the Arduino board.

5. Download and install the required libraries for the Arduino IDE.

6. Upload the code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

7. Connect the smart thermostat to your Wi-Fi network.
